Devious Devices - Expansion (DDx).
----------------------------------

DDx is a repository of 3'rd party devious devices, primarily aimed at expanding the list of devices avalible to DD
modders, however all devices are also craftable and usable on their own (crafting requires the Devious Smithing perk, 
obtainable via the Forbidden Tome quest).


Requirements:
-------------

HDT-HHS: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36213/?
DDA: http://www.loverslab.com/topic/19865-devious-devices-assets/
DDI: http://www.loverslab.com/topic/21484-devious-devices-integration-now-with-quests-05092014/

^And their respective requirements^


Installation:
-------------

Compatible with BAIN and FO-Mod installers.


Manual install:

Drag and drop the contense of the "00 Core" folder into the /Skyrim/Data/ folder.

Then depending on if you have the CBBE or the UNPB body installed, drag on drop the contense of either the "01 CBBE" or "01 UNPB" 
folder into the /Skyrim/Data/ folder. You do not need both! Only the one correspending to your installed body.


A note on the "Custom" devices:
-------------------------------

Some items from this pack, the Custom Blindfold and Custom Slave Harness, have the added abillity to block the wearer 
from wearing other clothing/armor items on the head and body. These devices can be quite punitive if used in conjunction
with mods like Chesko's Frostfall. You've been warned!

The Custom Harnesses also allow for beeing worn with a Chastity belt and Collar ontop of the Harness. The Harness mesh 
however was not designed with this in mind, so some minor clipping can occur with some combinations. A lot of effort has
gone into minimizing the clipping as much as reasonably possible, but it could not be fully avoided.


A note on Ebonite:
------------------

Ebonite is a shiny and slick leathery material created by infusing leather with a special Alchemical solution.
To craft Ebonite gear, you must first have the Devious Smithing perk, then at any forge, you can craft Ebonite Solution 
from the "Misc" section (requires 1x Chaurus Chitin, 2x Nirn-root, 2x Frostbite-spider-venom). With one or more bottles 
of Ebonite solution in your inventory, you can then take a standard leather device from DD-Assets to any tanning rack, 
and combine the item with the solution to craft it's shiny version (the leather item and solution is consumed in the process).

Ebonite crafting options will only show up at the tanning rack if you have a botte of Ebonite Solution in your inventory, 
this is to prevent spamming the rack's crafting menu with a whole bunch of items when not needed.


A note on Dyes:
---------------

Both standard Leather (items from DDi) and Ebonite items can now be dyed in other colours. To do so, first craft a dye 
from the "misc" section at any forge, and then take a black Leather or Ebonite item to any tanning rack. With a bottle of dye in 
your inventory, the tanning rack will display the full list of crafting options avalible for that colour dye. The dye is then simply 
combined with a black item to make the re.coloured version of that item, with bot the bottle of dye and the black item beeing 
consumed to do so.

Dye crafting options will only show up at the tanning rack if you have a botte of dye in your inventory, and only for that colour. 
This is to prevent spamming the rack's crafting menu with a whole bunch of items when not needed.
