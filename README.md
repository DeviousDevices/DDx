Devious Devices - Expansion (DDx).
----------------------------------
 
DDx is an add-on content pack for the Devious Devices family of mods, it's purpose, outside of adding more content for us all to play with, is largely as a framework. All items contained in the pack are useable as is, once you have obtained the "Devious smithing" perk from reading the "Forbidden Tome" at the college of Winterhold, they can all be crafted and used. But the real benifit to DDx is that it allows other DD-Plugins to freely make use of it's items, and incorporate them into gameplay without having to include versions of them in their own mods.
 
DDx is by it's very nature a collaborative project, this is where we place assets that fall outside the scope of the main DD-Assets mod, third party developed meshes, retextures, items which require outside dependancies (such as HDT-HHS for heels), that sort of thing.
Authorship of the content is thus more varied, containing work from many members of the DD team, aswell work from authors outside the team which is used with their kind permission.
 
All items in the pack are made with full support of DDa/DDi in mind, and supports both the UNP v1.2 and CBBE v3.2.3 bodies just as it's parent mods do. Items may also feature new textures to make them blend in with existing content when needed.
 
 
Requirements:

Supported UNP-TBBP body: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21199/?
 
 
Installation:
-------------

Compatible with BAIN and FO-Mod installers.
 
Manual install:
Drag and drop the contense of the "00 Core" folder into the /Skyrim/Data/ folder.
 
Then depending on if you have the CBBE or the UNP body installed, drag on drop the contense of either the "01 CBBE" or "01 UNP" 
folder into the /Skyrim/Data/ folder and say yes to merge and overwrite if prompted (You do not need both the CBBE and UNP folders! Only the one correspending to your installed body).


If using UNP-TBBP body, install Core and UNP files as above, then drag and drop the contense of the "02 UNP (TBBP)" folder into your /Skyrim/Data/ folder afterwards, say yes to merge and overwrite.
 
 
A note on the "Custom" devices:
-------------------------------
 
Some items from this pack, the Custom Blindfold and Custom Slave Harness, have the added abillity to block the wearer from wearing other clothing/armor items on the head and body. These devices can be quite punitive if used in conjunction with mods like Chesko's Frostfall. You've been warned!
 
The Custom Harnesses also allow for beeing worn with a Chastity belt and Collar ontop of the Harness.
 
 
A note on Ebonite:
------------------
 
Ebonite is a shiny and slick leathery material created by infusing leather with a special Alchemical solution.
To craft Ebonite gear, you must first have the Devious Smithing perk, then at any forge, you can craft Ebonite Solution from the "Misc" section (requires 1x Chaurus Chitin, 2x Nirn-root, 2x Frostbite-spider-venom). With one or more bottles of Ebonite solution in your inventory, you can then take a standard leather device from DD-Assets to any tanning rack, and combine the item with the solution to craft it's shiny version (the leather item and solution is consumed in the process).
 
Ebonite crafting options will only show up at the tanning rack if you have a botte of Ebonite Solution in your inventory, this is to prevent spamming the rack's crafting menu with a whole bunch of items when not needed.
 
 
A note on Dyes:
---------------
 
Both standard Leather (items from DDi) and Ebonite items can now be dyed in other colours. To do so, first craft a dye from the "misc" section at any forge, and then take a black Leather or Ebonite item to any tanning rack. With a bottle of dye in your inventory, the tanning rack will display the full list of crafting options avalible for that colour dye. The dye is then simply combined with a black item to make the recoloured version of that item, with both the bottle of dye and the black item beeing consumed in the process.
 
Dye crafting options will only show up at the tanning rack if you have a botte of dye in your inventory, and only for that colour. 
This is to prevent spamming the rack's crafting menu with a whole bunch of items when not needed.
 
 
Known issues:
-------------
 
* Players using custom race mods that contain a standalone bodymesh, installed in a different location than the default body mesh, may experiance clipping issues with the "Custom" versions of the Harness, as it loads the body-mesh from the default location, and not from the location used by the Race-mod. Status: This probably cannot be fixed.
 
* Clipping does occur when combining the "Custom" harness with belts and collars, most notably on the UNPB version, as the meshes were not designed to fit togeather in this way. Steps have been taken to minimize it as much as possible, but it could not be fully avoided. Status: A new mesh is needed and planned, but at this time it is on back-order, it may take a while.
